DAY 1
1. Write a program that converts upper case to lower.
2. Write a program to calculate the area of Circle.
5. Given two character inputs, find number of characters between them. For example, if 
input is ‘A’ and ‘E’ the output is 3.
6. Write a program to convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit 
7. Check if entered number is even or odd.
8. Check if entered year is leap year or not.
9. WAP to find power of 2^N using left shift operator.
10. Check if given input is a character or integer. (Use integer input within the range 0-9)
11. Generate two random numbers and find its sum (Hint: use rand() from stdlib.h)

DAY 2
1. Enter a 5 digit number and find the sum of its digits. For E.g. if int number = 12345; 
then sum = 15;
2. Write a program to reverse the number. For E.g. If int number = 12345; then the 
output reverse = 54321;
3. Write a program to count the occurrences of a digit in a number.
4. WAP to check if a given number is a palindrome. For e.g. 12321, 56788765;
5. Generate the first 'N' prime numbers. For Eg. If N=5 then 2,3,5,7,11
6. Write a C program to display and find the sum of the series 1+11+111+....111 up to n.
For eg. if n=4, the series is: 1+11+111+1111. Take the value of 'n' as input from the 
user
7. A number is called an Armstrong number if the sum of the cubes of the digits of the 
number is equal to the number. For example 153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3. Write a C 
program that asks the user to enter a number and returns if it is Armstrong or not.
8. Amicable numbers are found in pairs. A given pair of numbers is Amicable if the sum 
of the proper divisors (not including itself) of one number is equal to the other number 
and vice – versa. 
For example 220 & 284 are amicable numbers. First we find the proper divisors of 
220: 
220:1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110; 1+ 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 
+ 110 = 284
Now, 284: 1, 2, 4, 71, 142; 1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220 
Write a C program to check that the input pair of numbers is amicable
9. Write a menu driven program to read two integers & find their sum, difference & 
product.
10. Write a C program to calculate the volume of the following shapes: Cube, Cuboid, 
Sphere, Cylinder and Cone. Ask the user which one s/he wants to calculate, and take 
the appropriate required inputs. Then print the result. The input should be taken in the 
main function and calculations for every solid should be done in a separate function 
by passing appropriate arguments.
Example: If the user chooses the option for cube, only one input is required i.e., the 
side. The volume is then calculated and printed.
If the user chooses the option for cuboid, only three inputs are required i.e., length, 
breadth and height. The volume is then calculated and printed.
11. An Electricity board charges the following rates for use of electricity. 
For the First 200 units : Rs 5 per unit 
For the next 100 units : Rs7 per unit 
Beyond 300 units : Rs 10 Per unit. 
Write a C Program to read no of units consumed and print out total charge amount

DAY 3
1. WAP to convert a binary number to decimal and vice versa.
2. Generate a sequence of numbers such that every number in the sequence is the sum of 
the previous three numbers. The first three numbers are 0,0,1.
3. WAP to print the following sketch with input N as number of rows
****
 ***
  **
   *
4. Generate the following sequence using a single loop with N as number of rows
*
**
***
****
5. Write a C program, which will print two digit numbers whose sum of both digit is 
nine. e.g. 18,27,36......
6. Write a recursive function for calculating power of a number. Take base number and 
exponent from user.
7. Write a recursive function for calculating factorial of a number.
8. Use recursive calls to evaluate F(x) = x + x3/3! + x5/5! + x7/7!+ …
9. Concatenate two integer values using macros
10. Find square of a number using macros.
11. Write a menu driven program to display the mathematical functions like square root, 
natural log, log10x, power(x,n), Cos(x). (use math.h)
